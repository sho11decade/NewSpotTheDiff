# NewSpotTheDiff - Next-Generation Spot the Difference Auto-Generator

**NewSpotTheDiff** is an AI-powered web application that automatically generates spot-the-difference puzzles from a single uploaded image. Using advanced computer vision techniques, it detects objects and creates multiple strategic modifications to generate engaging puzzle variations at multiple difficulty levels.

## Features

### Core Capabilities
- **AI-Powered Object Detection**: Uses FastSAM (Segment Anything Model) for automated object segmentation
- **Intelligent Difference Generation**: Creates natural-looking differences through object deletion, color shifting, and duplication
- **Multi-Level Difficulty**: Generates puzzles at Easy, Medium, and Hard difficulty levels
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time job status updates with progress notifications
- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Interactive UI to compare original and modified images with reveal functionality

### Technical Highlights
- **CPU-Only Processing**: Designed for notebooks and laptops without GPU acceleration
- **Responsive Web Interface**: Drag-and-drop image upload with real-time feedback
- **Asynchronous Job Processing**: Background task processing using ThreadPoolExecutor
- **Robust Image Validation**: File type, size, and dimension verification with magic byte checking
- **Clean Architecture**: Separated concerns between routes, services, models, and utilities for maintainability

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later
- `uv` package manager (or pip)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd NewSpotTheDiff
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using UV**
   ```bash
   uv sync
   ```

   Or with pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the FastSAM model** (automatic or manual)

   Option A - Automatic (on first run):
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_model.py
   ```

   Option B - Manual:
   - Download `FastSAM-x.pt` from [Ultralytics Hub](https://hub.ultralytics.com)
   - Place it in `instance/models/` directory

4. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   python scripts/init_db.py
   ```

5. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python run.py
   ```

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. **Upload Image**: Navigate to the home page and drag-and-drop or select an image
   - Supported formats: PNG, JPEG
   - Image dimensions: 512px - 4096px
   - File size limit: 10MB

2. **Select Difficulty**: Choose puzzle difficulty level
   - **Easy**: 3-4 differences (larger, more obvious changes)
   - **Medium**: 5-6 differences (mixed object sizes)
   - **Hard**: 7-8 differences (smaller, subtle changes)

3. **Generate Puzzle**: Submit for processing
   - Processing time: 8-15 seconds (primarily for object detection)

4. **View Results**: Compare original and modified images
   - Toggle "Show Differences" to reveal answer
   - Download both original and puzzle images

## Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Purpose |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Web Framework | Flask 3.x | HTTP request handling and routing |
| Object Detection | FastSAM (Ultralytics) | AI-powered object segmentation |
| Image Processing | OpenCV | Inpainting, saliency analysis, color manipulation |
| Image Library | Pillow | Image format compatibility |
| Numerical Computing | NumPy | Array operations and processing |
| Database | SQLite | Job and result persistence |
| Package Manager | UV | Python dependency management |

## Configuration

Key settings in `src/config.py`:

```python
MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH = 10 * 1024 * 1024  # 10MB upload limit
MIN_IMAGE_SIZE = 512                    # Minimum dimension
MAX_IMAGE_SIZE = 4096                   # Maximum dimension
PROCESSING_SIZE = 1024                  # Standard processing size
MAX_WORKERS = 4                         # Background processing threads
DIFFICULTY_LEVELS = {
    'easy': (3, 4, 0.7),               # (min_diffs, max_diffs, quality_threshold)
    'medium': (5, 6, 0.5),
    'hard': (7, 8, 0.3)
}
```

## Development

### Running Tests
```bash
pytest
```

### Code Quality
The project uses Ruff for linting with a target line length of 100 characters.

```bash
ruff check .
```

### Database Schema
The application automatically initializes SQLite with the following tables:
- `jobs` - Tracks generation job status and progress
- `results` - Stores completed puzzle results and difference information

## Performance Characteristics

- **Object Detection (FastSAM)**: 8-12 seconds per image (CPU)
- **Saliency Analysis**: ~0.1 seconds
- **Inpainting per Object**: 0.3-0.8 seconds
- **Color Shifting**: ~50-100ms per object
- **Total Processing**: 8-15 seconds depending on image complexity and difficulty

These times are based on typical notebook hardware without GPU acceleration.

## Design Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**: Each service handles one concern for easier testing and maintenance
2. **Dependency Injection**: Services are injected via Flask app factory for flexibility
3. **Progress Reporting**: Generation pipeline supports callbacks for UI updates
4. **Error Resilience**: Comprehensive validation and error handling at system boundaries
5. **Clean Architecture**: Clear separation between routes, services, models, and utilities

## Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
- Object detection speed depends on CPU performance
- Large objects may use color change instead of deletion (OpenCV inpainting quality)
- Single image input (no batch processing)
- Differences are non-persistent (regenerated on each request)

### Planned Features
- Batch puzzle generation
- Persistent difference generation (same puzzle on revisit)
- User accounts and puzzle collections
- Multiplayer competitive mode
- GPU acceleration support
- Custom puzzle templates and difficulty fine-tuning

## Troubleshooting

### FastSAM Model Not Found
```
FileNotFoundError: FastSAM model not found
```
Solution: Run `python scripts/download_model.py`

### Image Upload Failed
- Verify image format is PNG or JPEG
- Check file size is under 10MB
- Ensure image dimensions are between 512px and 4096px

### Generation Timeout
- Processing typically takes 8-15 seconds
- Ensure browser doesn't close during processing
- Check browser console for errors

### Database Lock Error
- Ensure only one instance of the application is running
- Delete `instance/spotdiff.db` and reinitialize if corrupted
